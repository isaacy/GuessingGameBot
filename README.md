# GuessingGameBot
GuessingGameBot is an implementation of the guessing game exercise in most Computer Science Introductory class.  The structure of the game is based on a question/answer style, and fits nicely as a chatbot game!

I created this project to test out Azure Bot Service.  Azure Bot Service leverages the Microsoft Bot Framework and the Azure functions to help developer easily create a bot and host it in different messaging platforms.


##Requirement of the game
Write a program to play a guessing game:
- Ask the user what upper bound they want
- Repeatedly ask the user to guess a number and inform them if it is too high or too low
- The game ends when the user guesses the number or gives up (by guessing a negative number)
- Inform the user how many guesses were made
- When the game ends, ask the user if he/she wants to play again (yes/no)
- If they don't want to play again, print:
  - Number of games were played, the average number of guesses, and the lowest number of guesses results in a correct guesses.
